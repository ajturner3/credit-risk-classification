# Module 12 Report Template

1.	Explain the purpose of the analysis.
•	The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credit worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services.
  

2.	Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.
•	Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%
•	Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct
•	Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made


3.	Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any.  
•	I suggest employing this model to assess the credit reliability of loan applicants. Its ability to accurately predict the repayment of the first loan exceeds 95%, which can effectively be adapted into a risk profile for businesses. This approach can help in maintaining adequate capital for lenders, ensuring their continued operation and profitability.
